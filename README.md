# SIAS | Socially Intelligent Artificial Systems Group
 
## What we do
AI systems have fully permeated society and  are making positive impact in many ways. However, the widespread use of AI systems  also leads to unintended negative effects on people and society, including social inequality and discrimination. The SIAS research group studies how to advance people's everyday life and society in general through AI research, education and impact. The group engages in incremental trust building  and value learning with stakeholders  across various scientific disciplines and application domains, and on topics that are relevant both socially and academically.
